# Blackvas
![](blackvas.png)
Blackvas is an easy-to-use Canvas API Library which can handle declaratively. We free you from cumbersome procedural JavaScript code. We aim to make the design easy to use for both designers with little programming experience and front-end engineers accustomed to things like Vue and React.

## Dependent Technology
- Nim  
Blackvas is written by Nim-lang. Nim-lang is a statically typed programming language with a syntax similar to Python. It's probably very easy to learn.
- CSS  
Canvas graphics can be written with CSS properties that designers are familiar with.
